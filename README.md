## Take control to your presence on the Internet

### Solving the problem of maintaining accounts on multiple platforms

#### Links

- Links are the fundamental of the internet.
- Every person who is on the internet should have a safe place they can call home.
- Social media platforms like Friendster, Facebook and Twitter initially was popular because of the impression that it has the potential to become that safe space. History has proven otherwise.
- Ranting wants to solve that problem for Malaysia.

#### Malaysia

- Malaysia is a very unique country.
- As digital citizens, we Malaysians are very quick adopters to new technologies (Read why Apple is opening it's store in Kuala Lumpur).
- 

## B2C SaaS Model
